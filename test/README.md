# Your tests

This directory is intended for your own tests. So you can place your own tests in this directory.

## Lanvard tests
Because the lanvard/lanvard repository actually only contains configuration, the logic is mainly in the modules. If you are looking for Lanvard tests, then search in the other respositories. Tests are also referred to in the documentation.
