# Your Tests

This directory is intended for your own tests. So you can place your own tests in this directory.

## Lanvard Tests

Because the lanvard/lanvard repository actually only contains configuration, the logic is mainly in the repositories:

- [Foundation Tests](https://github.com/lanvard/foundation/tree/master/test)
- [Routing Tests](https://github.com/lanvard/routing/tree/master/test)
- [Support Tests](https://github.com/lanvard/support/tree/master/test)
- [Errors Tests](https://github.com/lanvard/errors)
