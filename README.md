## About Lanvard

Lanvard is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Lanvard takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects. Lanvard is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

> Lanvard combines the elegance of [Laravel (PHP)](https://laravel.com) and the strictness of Golang.

with the framework.

## License
